# M1S1-solar-system
In this repository, you'll find an example of our solar system made with unity, considering the following instructions:

- Create a small solar system with:
	-Sun (Center)
	-Mercury
	-Venus
	-Earth
		-Earth's moon
- Position them in a logical way in size and distance.
- Make the sun the parent of the other planets and, in the same way, make the earth the parent of moon.
